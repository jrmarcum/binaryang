/**
 * @module scripts/spec-prepare
 *
 * Split the WebAssembly spec testsuite's `.wast` scripts into modules plus JSON
 * assertion manifests, ready for `scripts/spec-testsuite.ts`.
 *
 * `.wast` files are SCRIPTS — modules interleaved with assertions — so they
 * cannot be fed to a module reader directly. Upstream `wast2json` does the
 * split, which is also why it must be on PATH.
 *
 * ```sh
 * deno task spec:prepare            # uses the default suite path
 * deno task spec:prepare <src> <out>
 * ```
 *
 * ⚠️ The suite lives in a SIBLING repo and is READ ONLY. Output goes only to
 * `<out>`, never beside the sources.
 *
 * ## The feature set is the whole design of this script
 *
 * 🔑 **`--enable-all` is WRONG here, and not for the reason it looks.** It does
 * not merely permit more — it changes what `wast2json` EMITS. With it, the
 * splitter produced binaries using the experimental *compact imports* proposal,
 * whose import-kind byte is `0x7F`. Those are not standard wasm: V8 rejects them
 * outright with *"Invalid import kind 127, enable with
 * --experimental-wasm-compact-imports"*.
 *
 * The harness then reported 58 "valid modules REJECTED" that were nothing of the
 * kind — our reader was right and the corpus was wrong. **A test corpus built
 * with the wrong flags measures the flags, not the code.**
 *
 * Going the other way is just as wrong: with the DEFAULT feature set only 157 of
 * 257 files convert, silently dropping SIMD, GC, threads, tail calls and more —
 * proposals this toolchain does support. That looks like a pass because the
 * failures never enter the corpus at all.
 *
 * So the set below is explicit: every proposal wabt-ts's `Features` claims,
 * MINUS the two it declares but its binary reader does not implement. Those are
 * tracked as a finding rather than hidden by a flag.
 */

/**
 * ⚠️ Deliberately NOT `--enable-all`.
 *
 * Excluded, and why:
 * - `compact-imports` — emits a `0x7F` import kind that is not standard wasm.
 *   wabt-ts declares `Features.compactImports` but the binary reader does not
 *   implement it (`unknown import kind: 127`). A declared flag is not an
 *   implementation; enabling it here would hide that gap behind 58 fake
 *   failures.
 * - `wide-arithmetic` — same shape: declared in `Features`, unimplemented.
